This is a very janky and poorly thought-out websockets server using asyncio.
I made it initally with the idea that I could offload some arbitrary work to other devices using python, specifically ffmpeg video conversion (although this turned out to be stupid). It's still possible...

This is pretty much just coding practice, but could theorhetically be sort of useful on some devices?
